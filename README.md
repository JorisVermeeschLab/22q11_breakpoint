# 22q11_breakpoint

This repository contains the targeted *de novo* assemblies of 22q11 regions for the patients and parents or origin (one folder per family) used to determine the deletions breakpoints. The seeds used to get the local assemblies are also available.

The custom scripts LCR_probes.pl and mafft_extract_SNPs.pl have been used to check the probe content of the local assemblies and get the SNPs from the MAFFT alignment of the local assemblies, respectively.
